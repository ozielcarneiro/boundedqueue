Runnable command-line function: main.cpp

This code was developed for KPCB Fellowship application. It asked for the development of a bounded queue code with the ability to initialize the queue, add integers to the queue and remove integers from the queue. It was also asked to try to optimize memory and run-time costs.

To test the data structure I used a runnable command-line function that asks the user what is going to be the size of the queue (for initialization purposes) and then what action the user wants to perform in the queue, enqueue a value, dequeue a value or end run. The enqueue and dequeue are handled by the boundedQueue class as asked in the application. After every action on the queue the queue is printed, using a method called printQueue() added to the boundedQueue class for debugging and testing.

There is no compilation or command-line arguments to run the program.
